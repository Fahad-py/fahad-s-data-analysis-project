Zomato Ratings Analysis Project



Project Overview:
This project involves cleaning and analyzing a dataset of restaurant ratings from Zomato, sourced from Kaggle. The focus is on understanding the distribution of ratings and identifying the best-rated restaurants by analyzing both numerical ratings and the sentiment of reviews. This beginner-level project aims to demonstrate basic data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and sentiment analysis techniques using Python libraries.

Dataset Description:
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains details of restaurants, including their ratings and customer reviews. Initial cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Kaggle notebooks to handle missing values, normalize rating formats, and prepare the data for analysis.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib: To create visualizations that illustrate rating distributions and comparisons.

TextBlob: For sentiment analysis on customer reviews to gauge positive and negative feedback.

Analysis and Insights:
The main objective was to explore restaurant ratings and extract meaningful insights:

Cleaned the dataset to ensure consistent rating formats.

Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the spread and frequency of ratings across different restaurants.

Conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews to complement numerical ratings with qualitative feedback.

Identified top restaurants that have the highest average ratings paired with the most positive sentiments in reviews.

Created visualizations to present the distribution of ratings and highlight standout restaurants.

Project Execution and Usage:
The entire analysis was carried out within Kaggle notebooks, making it easy to reproduce or extend the work. It can also be run in any Jupyter environment with the required libraries installed. No special configurations are necessary.

Purpose and Learning Outcomes:
This project serves as an introduction to practical data analysis workflows, combining numerical data analysis with sentiment analysis to gain richer insights. It highlights the importance of data cleaning and the use of visualization tools to communicate findings. This work lays a foundation for more advanced analytics projects on restaurant data or similar domains.
